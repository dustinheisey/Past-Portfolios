title: Web Design as a Tool for Social Change
---

We live in a time of alarming change. The earth is getting dangerously hotter, the oceans are rising, natural disasters are getting more intense and happening more quickly each day, diseases are becoming more prevalent and resistant to our antibiotics, agriculture is becoming less productive as a result of the shifting temperature zones, the air is getting unbreathable, and there is rising political instability all across the world.

Perhaps it is the exponential growth of our communicative abilities that has created a cloud of anxiety and distrust in our fellow human, filtering our everyday perspectives on life. Perhaps it is the cumulative effects of prioritizing short term gain over long term sustainability, compounding until it creates noticeable and now alarming issues in the global ecology of this planet. Perhaps it is a trial in the never-ending quest of the human species to claim conquest over nature that we have miserably failed at. Perhaps it is the mindless result of a chain of causes and effects that were destined to lead us to our current predicament.

Regardless of why, we are here now, in a world that is going to get more inhospitable for human life for every day that we continue to ignore this now incredibly obvious fact that we are at war with this planet, and we are going to lose if we keep fighting.

It would be inspiring, and now almost cliche to tell a story of how personal will to be better is enough to solve the massive problems of our time, however, that would be ultimately a lie, and disingenuous for me to say. With the exception of some very large changes to your life, namely transitioning to an entirely plant-based diet (which is much easier than you think) and utilizing public transportation as a replacement for your car, most of the emissions that have put our world in the endangered state it is in right now have not been produced by you.

It may be a tenant of our modern ethos: that what benefits the individual benefits the whole, and whatever choices result in more money for one will result in a better society for everyone. This idea has resulted in massive improvements in the quality of life of most people living on earth today, however at a hidden cost that is revealing itself now in a not so subtle way. In an assumed quest to improve consumer life, but an actual quest to improve business owners' wallet sizes, titans of industry, animal agriculture, and the dirty energy that fuels it all have had the unique opportunity to be the overwhelming majority emissions producer. They also get the added bonus of being the majority producer of human and animal suffering as well.

So what can be done? Have I just given you a philosophical excerpt into the failures of the human species, meant to inspire fear and depression, or is there some hope for us all? There may be. I will lay out 2 key issues that consumers who want to help save this planet from exterminating our species can focus on below, and below that, I will detail how web design can aid this endeavor even further.

## Political Action

A study by the Pew Research Institute found that America ranked 31st out of the 34 studied developed countries in voter turnout. That means 30 developed countries have a higher voter turnout than us. Those who wonder what we can possibly do to fight climate change and other existential threats to our health and happiness have an answer now. This is what we can do: Vote for representatives and laws that align with that goal, and support movements that aspire for social change.

## The Local Movement

People in Portland, The Pacific Northwest, and even the country as a whole are starting to strive towards more local, ethical, and environmentally friendly consumption. This is powerful. Each individual makes dozens of daily choices on how to consume the money that they earned by sacrificing their time and energy to work towards a businesses' goals that may or may not align with their own. Many people are not in the position to migrate to a job that is aligned with their goals, however, every individual is in control of what they consume. By supporting local, ethical and environmentally friendly businesses you are creating a direct and indirect benefit to your society and the world. Directly, you are producing fewer emissions, less waste, and less suffering. Indirectly you are voting to tip the balance away from big businesses who have abandoned all concern for the environment and the life that inhabits it.

## Positive Propaganda

In many ways, a website can be a propaganda machine. Those words may inspire a negative emotion or two, however, as much as it can help elect a representative who's goals are not aligned with the rest of the country, it can inspire a positive social movement that, once allowed to take root, compounds quickly. Designing for movements that align with this call to stop fighting the earth and start repairing the damage we have caused to it help to tip the balance in favor of said call, To change the ethos that pervades the minds of our society, and help give people who want to save this planet the power to do so.

## Helping Local Businesses

Carefully considered, human-centric web design is a powerful tool in the arsenal of small and local businesses to persuade consumers to help them have a larger impact than any individual can have on their own. Systems are more powerful than individual choices. Creating a website that speaks directly to people like the humans they are and motivates them to vote for a better future with their dollars, is a rather large upgrade to the system that is your local business, and it can enable you to have a much greater impact on your community.

This century began with the pervasive mentality that the pursuit of benefiting the individual can benefit society as a whole. This perspective has to change. This change is not some idealized fantasy or an unrealistic goal. It is essential for the continuation of our species. The current perspective must be superseded by the idea that what benefits society is beneficial for each individual. The pursuit of positive social change is beneficial for each of its inhabitants. And each of its inhabitants has a role to play in saving our society and our planet.
