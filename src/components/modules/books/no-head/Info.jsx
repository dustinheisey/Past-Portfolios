        On Having no Head: Zen and the Rediscovery of the
        Obvious.
      </h1>
      <p>
        D.E. Harding has a profound insight that on the
        surface seems completely absurd: He has no head, and
        neither do any of us. He explores why he thinks so
        and the implications it has.
